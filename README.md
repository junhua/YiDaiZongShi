# YiDaiZongShi

This is an archive project which I wrote a hack for the game Yi Dai Zong Shi ï¼ˆTaiwan Server).

I simply set up a proxy to monitor the APIs the game called for each actions and wrote the action simulations using Java. 

This hack helped me made a lot of friends and also made some money. Nonetheless I haven't been using it since I stopped playing.
